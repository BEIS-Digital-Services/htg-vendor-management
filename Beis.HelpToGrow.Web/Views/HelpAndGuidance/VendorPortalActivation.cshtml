      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Vendor portal activation</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">The primary contact on your original application form will receive an email to activate your Vendor Portal account.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The Vendor Portal will be the route for you to:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>submit and edit product details, including pricing</li>
        <li>add Vendor users to assist in the smooth running of the Vendor onboarding</li>
        <li>submit IP addresses</li>
        <li>configure your APIs</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Step 1: To activate the Vendor Portal</h3>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>follow the link provided in the email. Please note that this will be sent to the primary contact and must be completed by that individual</li>
            <li>check and confirm that your company details are correct, these will align with those provided in your application</li>
            <li>confirm that you are authorised to register on the Help to Grow: Digital Vendor Portal for your organisation</li>
            <li>provide consent to the website user terms and privacy policy</li>
            <li>activate the Vendor Portal (this will use a Microsoft authentication process)</li>
            <li>use the primary contact email for your username and create a password (that meets the stated password criteria)</li>
        </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Step 2: Adding Additional Users</h3>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>You will probably have additional colleagues in your organisation who will want to support your onboarding process for Help to Grow: Digital. This could include product owners, technical experts, and finance colleagues</li>
        <li>After you have created your own username and password, it will be possible to add other users from your organisation to allow them access to the Vendor Portal. You can add them straight away or they can be added at a later date</li>
        <li>You will be able to add a user’s email address and name and they will be sent a link to register to access the Portal</li>
        <li>Please be aware, any user added to the Vendor Portal will have the same access rights, so only add trusted colleagues. All users will have the ability to remove the access of other users at any point (e.g. if a colleague leaves your organisation)</li>
        <li>It is recommended that you add a colleague with the technical skills who will complete your company’s Application Programming Interface (API) configuration</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Step 3: Primary Contact</h3>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>As the primary contact you will receive all scheme communications</li>
        <li>The primary contact can be changed to another user if necessary, and this can be done on the Vendor Portal</li>
        <li>We would recommend changing the primary contact if you are going on a period of extended leave or if you are leaving the organisation to ensure effective communications between the scheme and your organisation</li>
      </ul>
