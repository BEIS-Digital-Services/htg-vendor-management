      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Phase 1: Planning your API configuration</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">To manage the process for redemption of grant tokens, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) will be used to pass information between Help to Grow: Digital and your website. Your organisation will be required to configure three APIs to manage redemption of grant tokens.</p>
      
      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Information for your software developer</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">You will receive a separate Vender Developer Guidance detailing API specifications and Swagger documentation. If you need to engage a third-party develop to configure this for you, you can share the document. You will also receive your access code and stub URLs with access to the Vendor Portal.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The three APIs are: </p>
      
      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">1. Voucher Check API</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">When your customer visits the redemption link, grant token details will be provided to this API. The API can authorise that the customer can redeem the grant token and discount. </p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">2. Redeem Update API</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">When your customer completes their transaction, this API will mark the grant token as used.</p> 

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">3. Reconciliation API</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">You will need to call this API daily to report all Help to Grow: Digital eligible sales to the grant administrator. </p>
